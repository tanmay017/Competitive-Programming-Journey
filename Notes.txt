ASCII Values :

'A' - 65
'a' - 97
0 - 48

Calculation Order in C++ Data-types : (Decreasing Order : First One is heighest)

1. Double
2. Float
3. Long Long Int
4. Long Int
5. Int
6. Characters

If there mixed Calculation of combined data types than output will be of higher types
For example : 
'a' + 1; // Outputs 98
7 / 2; // Outputs 3
7 / 2.0; // Outputs 3.5

Also first Calculation is done than data is store. For example;
double a = 3 / 2;
Outputs : 1
Because 3 and 2 both are integer types therefore there output will be of also of integer type than they will get store in a as double;
