For Contributing to Existing Project follow below steps : 
Step 1 : Fork the project to you own Account as a seperate repository
Step 2 : Now clone the project to own local system
Step 3 :  

Never commit on main branch . One branch is equal to one pull request. So always create a new branch for new requests
